#fullstack

Within the README, I will be updating my progress for this open source [Full Stack Project](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/general_info). I'm making this project a mission for me to complete over the summer of 2020, hoping to have a portfolio website created from scratch!


6/14: Started on the Full Stack! Went through part0, learned, reviewed the basics of HTML, CSS, and how to navigate through the "Inspect." I will be reading over the exercise links for part0 the next day :)

6/15: Read through the HTML, CSS, and web forms from Mozilla, and finished the rest of part 0's exercises. Briefly went over part 1's reading!
